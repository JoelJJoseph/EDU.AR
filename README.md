# EDU.AR
Make learning easier using AI and 3D models


## Inspiration
Traditional methods of education as we know it are becoming a thing of the past. Especially since the pandemic hit, students are using more technology than ever. With that in mind, I wanted to build something that will give students the 3D experience they get in the classroom while being virtual.

## What it does
EDU.AR is a site where students are able to learn and practice for different subjects using 3D models and Ai systems. AR in education helps students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject. A picture is worth a thousand words, right? So, instead of reading theory about something, students can see it with their own eyes, in action.

## How we built it
I first made the 3D models with Echoar and implemented that in our website. We used bootstrap for templates and ideas, than inclined the idea together.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a few challenges on the styling end and making sure not to break to code; Because we initially worked on different webpages first, it was difficult to merge them together. Making different models was the most annoying part it requires patience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In every Hackathon, proper time management ⏰plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; I understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct ✨and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.

## What we learned
During this project, I learned a lot about web technologies and hosting a site while working on our project, it definitely was a great learning experience. The whole training and implementing the model was new to most of us, and we had fun exploring it. We also implemented our 3d model using Echo AR and also learned how AR works.

## What's next for Edu.Ar
As for Edu.Ar, our team would like to add more subjects such as physics, calculus, history, and more. It is a great site for students to use and learn from.
